# Horse Racing Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of horse races using machine learning and deep learning. It combines web scraping, data preparation, and an LSTM model to analyze historical racing data and generate predictions. The workflow includes logging into the **Daily Racing Form (DRF)**, downloading necessary race data, and training a neural network for predictions.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above
- Google Chrome browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)

### Python Dependencies
Install required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy tensorflow scikit-learn requests
```

## Features

1. **Automated Login and Data Download**:
   - Uses Selenium to log in to DRF.
   - Navigates through the site and downloads race data in PDF format.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Processes a CSV dataset for training.
   - Applies scaling and padding to features for input into an LSTM model.

3. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - Trains an LSTM-based neural network to predict race outcomes.
   - Outputs a saved model (`horse_race_predictor_drf.h5`) for reuse.

---

## Usage

### 1. Setup
1. **Update `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH`**:
   - Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and update the path in the script.
2. **Create a Download Directory**:
   - Modify the `download_dir` variable to a directory where PDFs will be saved.

### 2. Running the Script
Run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Input Data
- Update the path to your CSV file in the `main()` function (`csv_file_path`).

### 4. Outputs
- The trained model is saved as `horse_race_predictor_drf.h5`.
- Logging messages will provide updates on each step.

---

## Key Functions

### `selenium_login_and_download(username, password, access_date, download_dir)`
- Logs into DRF and downloads the specified race PDF.
- Requires manual CAPTCHA completion during login.

### `prepare_data(file_path)`
- Prepares the dataset for the LSTM model by scaling and padding features.

### `build_lstm_model(input_shape)`
- Builds and compiles the LSTM model for binary classification.

### `main()`
- Orchestrates the entire process: login, data download, preparation, model training, and saving.

---

## Notes

- **Manual CAPTCHA**: The login process requires manual completion of the CAPTCHA.
- **File Paths**: Ensure all file paths (e.g., CSV dataset) are updated correctly.
- **PDF Download**: The script assumes the PDF link is accessible after navigating to the page.

---

## Future Improvements

- Automate CAPTCHA handling.
- Expand the model to handle multiclass predictions (e.g., top 3 finishers).
- Improve error handling for web scraping and file operations.
